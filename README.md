# Social Engineering Defense Mechanisms

Capstone project tackling phishing and vishing threats through behavioral simulations and a web-based awareness hub.

## üîç Project Overview

Phishing scams cost over $10.3B annually (FBI IC3, 2022). This project focuses on psychological manipulation used in social engineering attacks and builds a simulation and education system to help users recognize and defend against them.

## üí° What We Built

- **Phishing Simulations** ‚Äì Python-based emails mimicking Facebook, Google, Amazon to analyze click rates and logging behavior.
- **AI Vishing Calls** ‚Äì Automated Twilio calls simulating urgent scam scenarios (e.g., bank fraud alerts).
- **Awareness Hub** ‚Äì Interactive web modules on phishing types, training quizzes, and a reporting tool.

üîó **Website Demo**: (https://phishingtrainningmodules.netlify.app/email-phishing)

## üìä Outcomes

- Increased phishing awareness from **55% to 85%** after training.
- Highlighted the psychological factors behind phishing (urgency, authority).
- Framework shared with university cybersecurity forums.
